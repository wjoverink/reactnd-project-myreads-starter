# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal is to create a  bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
